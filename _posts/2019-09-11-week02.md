The types of projects that interest me pertain towards gaming, game design, and making gameplay a bit more juicier. After I made a game, I realized that I only had bearbones gameplay and no extra things like sounds when clicking/jumping to make gameplay just a little bit less stale, so the way I am going to start out contributing to open source projects would be to suggest new features and options, and make comments to make the game more appealing to play. SuperTuxKart is the mario kart esque open source video game I was looking towards improving. There are small things like adding a start boost, changing the spedometer to more resemble those in modern cars (the way you see your speed is a bar in that goes around the spedometer in the game, which can be difficult to see on brighter or more intense maps.
