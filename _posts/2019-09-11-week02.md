  The types of projects that interest me pertain towards making gameplay a bit more _juicier_. After I made a game, I realized that I only had bearbones gameplay and no extra things like sounds when clicking/jumping to make gameplay just a little bit less stale, so the way I am going to start out contributing to open source projects would be to suggest new features and options, and make comments to make the game more appealing to play.

  **SuperTuxKart** is the mario kart esque open source video game I was looking towards improving. There are small things like: 
  1. adding a start boost, 
  2. changing the spedometer to more resemble those in modern cars (the way you see your speed is a bar in that goes around the spedometer in the game, which can be difficult to see on brighter or more intense maps), 
  3. having a better song play in the background
  4. not having the cars bounce into the sky when they fall from a height into a slanted map.
