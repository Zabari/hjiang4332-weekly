  To be fully honest, I thought that open source projects would be completely free. I never knew that to be classified as open source, only the source code needs to be free. Thus, people make a lot of money offering support or added features into free open source projects. I looked into projects like these and found out that **_oracle's_** MySQL database is completely open source, but they have plans fo subscriptions that cost between $2,000 and $10,000. Promises of support ,stores, partitions, and more. After reading that mysql offers support if people pay, #3 didnt really surprise me. I also naturally assumed that open source: 
  * was not just for people
  * You dont have to be an expert to use it (learned from class/reading about how to contribute)
  * Most open source software is as reliable and maybe even better than the proprietary counterpart
  * and that I am already using it (Mozilla Firefox).
