As Vice president of _Esports and Game Design Collective_ and hoping to make an npo under the same name, I strive to make game design *more affordable* in cunys. Most of the best game design programs are in schools with extremely high tuition, which cuts off the creativity and aspirations from the people who are unable to take these courses.

### More Information

I've made 3 games in game programming 2 and one game through our game studio program in which I attended global game jam and pushed out the game in 3 days.
